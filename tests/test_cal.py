"""calendar-cli is a command line utility, and it's an explicit design
goal that it should contain minimal logic except for parsing and
passing command line options and parameters to the caldav library and
printing output from the caldav library.  Functional tests verifying
that the tool actually works as intended is done through shell
scripts, and can be run through test_calendar-cli.sh.  There is no
goal to get complete code coverage through this unit test, though any
"extra" logic except for simple passing of options and parameters to
the caldav library ought to be tested here.  """
